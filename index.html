This year alone, there have been over 46,000 fires of varying size and severity across the U.S.. While many of the fires go unnoticed by the general public, other fires are immense in their size and voracity and burn thousands of acres in a single day destroying anything in their path. Recent analysis shows that over 46 million homes and 70,000 communities are at risk. Since the year 2000, at least 10 states have had their largest fires on record. </p>

		 <p>In recent years wildfires have burned huge swaths of land across the United States. In fact, some states have seen more than one percent of their total square miles burned in a given year. In 2015 alone, over two percent of the state of Washington was burned in wildfires. The same year, nearly one percent of Oregon and Idaho also burned.<br><br>The data used in the map was compiled from the <a href="https://www.nifc.gov/">National Interagency Fire Center</a>. The total number of square miles burned was collected for each state (2015-2019). The data was normalized by the total number of sqm. and then converted into a percentage for display.
